## Getting Started

To get started with Bulk Chain Shell, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/NOOBKABHA/bulk-chain-shell/releases). Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
- **SQLite3**: This is required for data management.
- **A Terminal or Shell**: Access to a command-line interface is essential.

### Installation

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/NOOBKABHA/bulk-chain-shell/releases) section and download the latest version.
2. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file to your desired location.
3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted the files.
4. **Run the Shell Client**: Execute the shell client using the command:

   python bulk_chain_shell.py
   ```

### Usage

Once the shell client is running, you can start using the commands to interact with your data. Here are some examples of how to use the client:

- **Load Data**: Load your data into the shell using:
  ```bash
  load data <your_data_file>
  ```
  
- **Run Reasoning Queries**: Perform schema-based reasoning with:
  ```bash
  query "What is the relationship between X and Y?"
  ```

- **Save Results**: Save your results back to SQLite3 with:
  ```bash
  save results to <your_database>
  ```

### Example Commands

Here are a few example commands you can run in the Bulk Chain Shell:

- **List Available Datasets**:
  ```bash
  list datasets
  ```
